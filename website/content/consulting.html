<h2>Managed IT</h2>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>Are you using an @gmail.com email address for your business? Professionals use branded email addresses (e.g. name@company.com), but you don't have the sacrifice the convienience and familarity of email services like Gmail to look professional. Google Workspace offers professional email services that use the same Gmail client that you are familar with. Ask me about fully managed email with Google Workspace.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>I have helped small and medium businesses configure everything from new routers to full enterprise networks with firewalls, switches, and wireless access points. Maintaining and securing network is critical to business continuity and customer privacy.</p>

<h3>Helpdesk</h3>
<p>Not large enough for a dedicated IT team? We can set up a dedicated helpdesk for your company and field all technology-related inquires. Most issues can be resolved quikcly over Zoom meetings using screen control.</p>

<h3>Hardware procurement</h3>
<p>I know that it can be overwhelming to shop for a new computer or other IT hardware. So many brands, models, configurations. I have experience working with a variety of resellers and directly with manufacturers to get the best deals on new and used equipment.</p>

<h3>Phones and VoIP</h3>
<p>Are you ready to transition to an internet phone solution using voice over IP (VoIP)? We can configure a hosted VoIP solution with multi-level menus, extensions, and physical phones. Voicemails can be sent to email addresses rather than calling into the system.</p>
