*How* we say something is just as important as *what* we say. You will rarely hear me use "I" when describing something that I did or am doing. This was never intentional, but I recently started to notice how much other people [inappropriately] use "I". 

The last time you asked a store associate to help you find something, they might have said "I might have one of those" or "I have one out back". This is painful for me to hear. It is cutting everyone else out of the picture, least of all those that actually own the products. A simple "we" would put all of those people back into the picture. This doesn't just apply to retail. Unless you are a one-person business and you make everything that you sell, you should be using "we" more than "I". There is always someone else to give credit.


There are very few times that I don't use "we" or "us" at work to describe something that we (IT) did or are doing. Even if I did the majority of the work myself, there is almost always someone else that has touched it, whether or not they are part of our team.

I, we, and  they.

I and We

Have you ever heard a retail associate say "I have two of those" or "I might have one out back". I'm not trying to disuade people from taking responsibility for their jobs or workplaces, in fact, taking responsibity critical, but so is recognizing that you are a piece of a bigger picture, part of a team. Saying "I" cuts everyone else out of the picture. In most cases, the individual doesn't have anything, the store does. "I" syndrome is communicable - if our peers say it, so should we.

They

I was at the grocery store last week and I asked a store associate if they had a certain product. The replay was "I don't think that they have it".

Another grivence I have with retail is when associates use "they" to describe the store. Using "I" instead of "we" pales in comparison to using "they" to describe something that you are a part of. When I hear employees say "they" I blame managers for not encouraging and norturing a sense of community where the employee feels like a part of the team, not seperate from it. "They" implies that you are just walking through the store and happen to be wearing a shirt that looks an awful lot like the uniforms that employees are wearing.
