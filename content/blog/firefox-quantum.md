## Overview

I have been using Google Chrome as my primary web browser and recommending it to collegues for years. Using Google Chrome was a decision based mostly on performance and compatibility, but also partially on design. Firefox's newest release v.57.0, i.e. Firefox Quantum, changed things for me. The new version has a redesigned UI which rivals Chrome in terms of simplicity and the preformance exceeds that of Google Chrome.

## Design

Looking only at the design on the web browser, the new Firefox is a **huge** improvement over the older versions (Fig. 1; far left and right respectively). Further, Quantum is even cleaner than Google Chrome (Fig. 1; center)! Quantum's new tab goes right to the top of the window, utilizing every bit of available realestate without dipping down into content land. I know that we're talking about a few pixels here, but I take my screen realestate seriously. 

Quantum also ditches the curves and color gradients; seriously, we live in a flat world now! I'm not even going to comment on the rendering of the bookmark bar in Firefox 56.

## Performance

I have done a few page load comparisons between Firefox and Chrome. In my limited, unscientific, testing, some pages load faster in Firefox and some load faster in Chrome. In my day-to-day usage, I haven't noticed any speed difference.

## Printing & Google Docs

The only gripe I have with Firefox Quantum is the lack of printing compatibility with Google Docs (which I use often). When you try printing a Google Doc from Quantum, you get a Google Cloud Print dialog with options to "Print from my computer" or "Save to Google Drive". When you select "Print from my computer" it downloads the file as a PDF for you to "print from your computer". Come on! I just want to print a document, not download it. 

I suppose that this is probably more of a "Google pushing Google Cloud Print" thing and less of a "Firefox not supporting Google Docs" thing. But still.

Chrome also excells at PDF viewing. In Firefox, you need the Adobe plugin to view PDFs in-browser, which Chrome does natively. 


## Conclusion

I never thought that I'd stray from Chrome, but Firefox's sleek new UI combined with its powerful engine makes it my new favorite web browser.
