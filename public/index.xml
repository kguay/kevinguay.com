      <title>Hugo: HTML code in content files</title>

      <description>TL;DR You can use HTML in Hugo content files (markdown files) by including some (any) markdown code at the top of the page (e.g. an empty header #).
Background I recently switched this website&amp;rsquo;s backend to Hugo instead of HarpJS. I have been using HarpJS for two years and love it. It is a very minimal static website compiler that has support for some great languages, including Pug (formerly Jade), Sass/Less, as well as the usual suspects, including HTML (EJS) and Markdown.</description>

      <title>Ansible OS Distribution and Version</title>

      <description>The Gist Ansible has built-in &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about your hosts that make it easy to find basic information such as hostname, operating system, IP address. This is great for debugging or inventorying systems, however OS version is not included and it was surprisingly difficult to find a way to print this information out. I understand that Ansible is OS-independant (and hence OS-version-independant), however, it can be useful to know which servers are running CentOS/RH 6 vs 7.</description>

      <title>Mounting CIFS in CentOS 7</title>

      <description>The Problem Most of my servers (virtual machines) are running CentOS 6, but the new ones run CentOS 7. This morning I setup a new CentOS 7 box and was trying to mount a CIFS storage share to it. I copied the line in /etc/fstab that mounts the share, created the secure credentials file, and the mount directory. However, when I ran mount /mnt/share it failed with the following error:</description>

      <title>Setting Up Ansible with Ansible</title>

      <description>Background I am responsible for a few dozen linux servers at work, and although there was an effort to install Salt a few years ago, they are all managed individually and manually. I spend more time than I should ssh&amp;rsquo;ing into boxes to add users. install applications, or restart services. I looked into Puppet a few months ago, but it seemed to complicated and clunky for my environment. Specialty, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install and troubleshoot the client on dozens of serveres.</description>

      <title>Favorite Open Source Projects</title>

      <description>Overview Open source projects are great in every way. Aside from being free, they offer programmers of all levels a chance to get some real world experience and contribute to the public domain. I am certainly guilty of using open source software and not contributing to it, but that is about to change.
Below is an annotated list of my favorite open source projects. I will make an effort to update this list regularly.</description>

      <description>It started with a book I have always loved book stores. From local mom &amp;amp; pop&amp;rsquo;s to Barns &amp;amp; Noble. I am also a huge fan of Amazon. Quite the dichotomy, huh? On a recent trip to Boston, I visited a brick and mortar Amazon Book Store. Problem solved. This was, hands down, the best (and probably smallest) book store that I have ever been to. The size forced the inventory to be highly curated, typically an extremely subjective process.</description>

      <description>Woodworking -- I have been working with wood since I was a kid, but recently I dove head first into fine woodworking and furnituremaking. I particularly enjoy building shaker-style and shaker-influlenced furniture. The design philosophy of &amp;ldquo;form follows function&amp;rdquo; resonates with me.
I discovered Fine Woodworking Magazine at my local library and started ingesting the information one issue at a time. I discovered that by reading so much about how to build fine furniture, that I skipped right over the not-so-fine furniture that many people start with.</description>
