I was recently given a manual for Apple's 2002 clamshell iBook. We have one in our office "Mac Museum" and it is one of my favorites! I mean, what other laptop has a built-in handle. One of these days I'm going to walk into a meeting and use it to take notes.. on OS 9.

As I was flipping through the pages of the User Manual, there was a screenshot showing an email about their new computer. The message reads:

To: Peter35@apple.com

Subject: New Computer

I just set up my new Macintosh, and it's great. I am having so much fun searching the Internet and sending e-mail to my friends. I found a great site where you can buy books online and they deliver them right to your doorstep.

Take care,

Susan
