## Consulting

Below is a list of websites that I have developed recently:

- <a href="https://www.mookseafarm.com" target="_blank">Mook Sea Farm</a>
- <a href="https://www.dayshardwood.com" target="_blank">Day's Hardwood</a>
- <a href="https://www.finewoodworkingindex.com" target="_blank">Fine Woodworking Index</a>

### Websites
I can develop websites on any platform, but I prefer static websites for their speed, simplicity, and security. If you want more control over your content, a Wordpress site makes the most sense since it provides an easy interface for making edits. Regardless of platform, I'm happy to discuss building a new website for your business.

### E-commerce
E-commerce websites are easier than ever to build and manage with Shopify. I can get a site up and running for you in a few hours and customize almost everything to fit your brand/needs. Best of all, it is easy and intuitive to manage on the backend. There is almost no learning curve to add/edit products, manage inventory, and fulfill orders.

### Email
If you are familar with Gmail, you will be right at home with custom domain email in GSuite. It offers everything that Gmail does (mail, chat, calendar, drive, etc.), but with your custom email address (you@yourbusiness.com). Managed plans start at $5/user/month and include unlimited storage.
