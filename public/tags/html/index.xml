      <description>TL;DR You can use HTML in Hugo content files (markdown files) by including some (any) markdown code at the top of the page (e.g. an empty header #).
Background I recently switched this website&amp;rsquo;s backend to Hugo instead of HarpJS. I have been using HarpJS for two years and love it. It is a very minimal static website compiler that has support for some great languages, including Pug (formerly Jade), Sass/Less, as well as the usual suspects, including HTML (EJS) and Markdown.</description>

      <title>Ansible OS Distribution and Version</title>

      <description>The Gist Ansible has built-in &amp;ldquo;facts&amp;rdquo; about your hosts that make it easy to find basic information such as hostname, operating system, IP address. This is great for debugging or inventorying systems, however OS version is not included and it was surprisingly difficult to find a way to print this information out. I understand that Ansible is OS-independant (and hence OS-version-independant), however, it can be useful to know which servers are running CentOS/RH 6 vs 7.</description>
