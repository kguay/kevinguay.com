I, we, and  they.

I and We

Have you ever heard a retail associate say "I have two of those" or "I might have one out back". I'm not trying to disuade people from taking responsibility for their jobs or workplaces, in fact, taking responsibity critical, but so is recognizing that you are a piece of a bigger picture. Part of a team. Saying "I" cuts everyone else out of the picture. In most cases, the individual doesn't have anything, the store does. I believe that "I" syndrome is communicable - if our peers say it, so should we.

They

I was at the grocery store last week and I asked a store associate if they had a certain product. The replay was "I don't think that they have it".

Another grivence I have with retail is when associates use "they" to describe the store. Using "I" instead of "we" pales in comparison to using "they" to describe something that you are a part of. When I hear employees say "they" I blame managers for not encouraging and norturing a sense of community where the employee feels like a part of the team, not seperate from it. "They" implies that you are just walking through the store and happen to be wearing a shirt that looks an awful lot like the uniforms that employees are wearing.
