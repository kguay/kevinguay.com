I feel fortunate to have grown up with computers. That is, I grew up at the same time as computers were growing up. The first computer that my family owned was a IBM PS2. I remember the pixelated black and white icons on the desktop. I booted that computer up every few years just to reminisce on how far technology had come.

I got my first computer in 2003 for my 13th birthday. I remember opening it like it was yesterday. My parents had hidden it in a corner of the room and of course I knew right away what the tower and display-shaped boxes held. It was an eMachine desktop and I was thrilled. We immediately set it up on a desk in my room - printer and all. We had a family computer in the basement, but this was my first personal computer where I didn't have to worry about time sharing. 

I have always been slightly (okay - totally) obsessed with Apple. I can't say that I wasn't a little dissapointed that I didn't receive a Macinsosh, but that was a little outside of the budget. But that didn't stop me. I downloaded numerous extensions/themes/tools in attempts to transform Windows XP into Mac OSX. One application acted as a, slightly clunky, dock. Another changed the window close, min, and max icons to red, yellow, and green circles. Yet another added a menu bar to the top of the screen rather than at the top of an application window. Backgrounds, system icons, sounds, and cursors were all changed to mimic Apple's superior OS.

As you might imagine, all of this tweaking and third party software didn't come without problems. Registery keys were messed up. DLL files went missing. Themes were broken. I reinstalled Windows XP so often that the install screens are burned into my memory. I learned the ins and outs of registery keys, system files, the BIOS, startup options, and more. I learned more from trying to make my computer look like a Mac than I ever could have learned in a class.
