In my last post about email security, I talked about *why* you should have strong passwords, especially for your email accounts, but I didn't address how. Here are some rules of thumb to help you secure your digital world.

## 1. Use a password manager
There are a trove of password managers available. Most populare are 1Password, LastPass, and Dashlane. 1Password is my favorite. The company provides a robust product that integrates seemessly with every OS (including linux) and web browser.

## 2. Use a password generator
Humans are notoriously bad a being random. If you don't believe me try <a href="https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html" target="_blank">this excercise</a>. Most password managers provide a password generator capable of generating truely strong passwords. They will either generate a string of random characters (including numbers and symbols; e.g. o7JXb[g7VnPF4kHX9Dh^) or a series of random words pulled from a dictionary file (e.g. uniaxial-sandman-format-strophe). While using passwords comprised of only one or two words is vulnerable to dictionary attacks, strings of three or more words are much harder to guess. Using truely random passwords eliminates the risk of your password being guessed by a hacker based on your interests, where you live, or what you do, most of which is publically available thanks to the internet and social networks.

## 3. Make it long
I recently signed up for a new account. The password had the following requirements:

 - between 5 and 8 characters
 - one capital letter
 - one lowercase letter
 - one special character

The company was simply adhering to the best practices in information security... 10 years ago.

A lot has changed in 10 years. For one, computers are much more powerful. What use to require a rack full of servers can now be done on your iPhone. This includes hacking passwords. Computers can try millions of passwords every second, taking less than an hour to brute force an eight-character password (i.e. trying every combination of characters until the correct password is found).

Any eight character password is useless, but unfortunately some companies aren't willing to update their legacy infrastructure that is limiting the password length. In that case, you should be as random as possible and demand that the company update their security.

Most websites do accept long passwords. You should use 15 characters as your *minimum* password length. Ideally, it would be over 20 characters. Don't worry, if you're using a password manager, you won't have to remember it!

That's it. If you follow these three rules, you will be way ahead of the game.
