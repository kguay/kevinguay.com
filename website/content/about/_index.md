## Background

Growing up, I split my free time between playing in the woods behind my house and "playing on the computer", althouth most people would consider it "working on the computer". For example, in high school I built a large website from scratch for a new non-profit organization. That catalyzed my interest in technology as a career. At Hobart and William Smith Colleges, I studied computer science, environmental studies, and geology. I have spent my career combining these disciplines through research, programming, and technology roles at non-profit organizations focused on the environment and climate change.

While at the Woods Hole Research Center, I published several peer-reviewed papers in academic journals and wrote chapters in scientific books. My background in computer science, Linux systems, and research, made me an ideal candidate to run Bigelow Laboratory's IT department. At Bigelow, you might find Kevin improving network security, developing applications, or configuring a new high performance computer.

Kevin lives with his wife in Brunswick, Maine and enjoys making shaker-style furniture in his free time. When he's not in his woodshop, Kevin enjoys rock climbing, canoeing, fly fishing, and playing board games.

## Woodworking

I have been working with wood since I was a kid, but recently I dove head first into fine woodworking and furnituremaking. I haven't looked back. I particularly enjoy building shaker-style and shaker-influlenced furniture. The design philosophy of "form follows function" resonates with me.

I discovered Fine Woodworking Magazine at my local library and started ingesting the information one issue at a time. I discovered that by reading so much about how to build fine furniture, that I skipped right over the not-so-fine furniture that many people start with. By the time I got my first dovetail saw and cut my first set of [far from perfect] dovetails, I was not intimated because I had read so much on technique. I got by with a simple set of tools in the second bedroom of our small apartment for a year or two. By the time I had an opportunity to use a fully equipt shop, I knew how to use every machine to accomplish exactly what I wanted.
